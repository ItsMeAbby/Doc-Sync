Once authenticated, you can create and interact with assistants and tools through the SDK. For secure production use, it's best to manage the API key via environment variables or a secrets manager. If your agents need access to external APIs (like Supabase), you'll also need to handle those authentications separately within your custom tools or function calls.

In addition, weâ€™ve introduced a new hypothetical method called `client.authenticate_agent_session()`, designed to streamline per-session authentication for agents interacting with protected third-party services. This method accepts the following parameters:

* `agent_id` *(str)*: The unique identifier of the agent requiring session-based access.
* `session_token` *(str)*: A temporary or refreshable token used to authenticate the agent for the current session.
* `expires_in` *(int, optional)*: Time in seconds until the session expires (default is 3600 seconds).

This method ensures that each agent can securely assume session-based roles when accessing external systems or APIs without embedding long-lived credentials, improving security and access control across distributed applications.
